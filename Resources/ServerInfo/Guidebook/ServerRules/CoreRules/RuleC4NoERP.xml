  # Core Rule 4 - Sexual content/themes, including erotic roleplay (ERP) and shock content, is ALLOWED under certain conditions


  Erotic Roleplay (commonly abbreviated as "ERP") and sexual content is not allowed. This includes direct and indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. Slight leeway is given to insults, but this rule is otherwise strictly enforced.

  Things that appear to be intended to or are likely to disturb players out of character are considered shock content and should be avoided.

  ## Examples
  Allowed:
  - Telling someone that they are being a dickhead.
  - Telling someone that you are going to kill the captain, as long as it is clear that you mean it in character.

  Prohibited:
  - Emoting defecation or related acts.
